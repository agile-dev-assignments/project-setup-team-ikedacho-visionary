# Project Repository
*   Project Description, Product Vision Statement
    *   O-zone is a cross-platform social media browsing web application. It should support popular platforms including but not limited to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tiktok. Our project makes it convenient to gather information from and push posts to multiple platforms at the same time. 
    *   Minimum Viable Product:
        *   Basic functionality
            *   Access to user's registered social media accounts; 
            *   Display contents of popular posts from multiple social media platforms on the home page; 
            *   Allow users to send new posts to multiple social media platforms via O-zone;
            *   Set up user accounts on the platform. 
    *   Roles of team members:
        *   Product Manager: 
            *   Before the sprint planning phase, PM finishes writing a list of user stories.
            *   In the sprint planning phase, PM explains every user story to developers.
            *   In the sprint planning phase, PM collaborates with the developers to determine the Acceptance Criteria of User Stories which represents the minimum requirements for User Stories to be considered done. 
            *   In the sprint planning phase, PM collaborates with the developers to do the Estimation of Effort of each User Story to determine how much work the User Story will be. Planning Poker is used to determine the workload of the User Story.
            *   In the sprint planning phase, based on the Estimation of Effort of each User Story, PM collaborates with the developers to divide each user story to tasks. Each task should be done by one developer in 2 days, before the next Scrum Meeting/Daily Standup. Each task is assigned to one developer. 
            *   In the stakeholder demo phase, the PM collects stakeholderâ€™s suggestions, and adds new user stories to the list.
        *   Scrum Master:
            *   Ensure the team is following the scrum framework in the agile way.
            *   Remind members of what to do in the scrum meeting.
            *   Remind members of their role and their tasks.
        *   Developers: 
            *   In the sprint planning phase, after PM explains the user story, developers collaborate with the PM to determine the Acceptance Criteria of User Stories which represents the minimum requirements for User Stories to be considered done. 
            *   In the sprint planning phase, developers collaborate with the PM to do the Estimation of Effort of each User Story to determine how much work the User Story will be. Planning Poker is used to determine the workload of the User Story.
            *   In the sprint planning phase, based on the Estimation of Effort of each User Story, developers collaborate with the PM to divide each user story to tasks. Each task should be done by one developer in 2 days, before every Scrum Meeting/Daily Standup.
            *   In the sprint planning phase, developers determine some spikes for the sprint, such as setting up the environment for the project to run and what to learn in order to finish the task.
            *   Developers complete the task or the spike assigned to them in 2 days before the next scrum meeting.
